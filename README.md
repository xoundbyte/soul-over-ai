## Soul Over AI - A public index of AI-generated and AI-assisted music
This repo is an independently curated, community-informed directory documenting artists involved in AI-generated or AI-assisted music.
It is used to power the website [Soul Over AI](https://souloverai.com).

If you want to use the raw data, it is available [here](/dist/artists.json) but please attribute Soul Over AI in accordance with [our licensing terms](./LICENSE.md).

## Maintenance and Contribution
This project collects AI artist data submitted by the community via [souloverai.com](https://souloverai.com).
Each submission triggers a manual review process before being added to the list.
While the community provides the raw data, the ongoing curation, validation, and maintenance of the dataset are managed independently.
