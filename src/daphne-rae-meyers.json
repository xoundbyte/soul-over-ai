  "markerNotes": "The artist has released 16 albums in 2025 with 5 monthly listeners on Spotify and no bio. The genres range from Christmas, to country, to epic pop. The album art is inconsistent, for example Rose Haven Christmas is a rectangle and not square, 'Emberwake Back To Our Music' has a guitar with completely incorrect stringing and pegs, and 'Emberwake Ancient Truths' album cover looks like a book cover.",
