The project is a manifestation of an endless fascination with tinkering and exploring the boundaries of artificial intelligence in the musical realm - while still placing human creativity at its core. We bring visionary ideas to life using a dedicated AI toolkit, including Gemini (for concepts, synopsis, and prompting ideas), Suno (for music and vocals), and OpenArt (for album art and covers).\"",
