Started recording and making my own music in 2019-2024, but I wasn’t in the best situation mentally nor spiritually. However, I did learn a lot about how to edit sound and write lyrics. Sometime in early 2024 I began making all sorts of different content and learning how to video edit and use a wide variety of AI models for visuals/sounds/voices.\"",
