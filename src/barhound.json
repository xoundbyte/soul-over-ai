Vocals and instruments are AI-assisted. My natural voice is smoother, and I primarily play acoustic rhythm and percussive guitar. The final mix includes AI-generated enhancements and additional instrumentation. Lyrics are written by me. I occasionally use ChatGPT for editing, proofing or rhyming help.\"",
